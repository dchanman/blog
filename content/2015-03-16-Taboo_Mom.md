I found out today that my mom is a beast at Taboo. I can't believe how good she is at this game. She speaks English for probably a half hour each day. She usually forgets my friends don't speak English and starts drifting off into Cantonese.

Here were some of her descriptions:

>"You find rat and ant in your house."

The answer: **pest**

>"You buy two apples you pay ten dollar how do you figure out how to pay for each?"

The answer: **division**

>"Go to the airport, dad doesn't drive you, you call..."

The answer: **taxi**

Yeah wow, I hope there's some Taboo competition for money somewhere; I'm gonna bring my mom to shark some poor noobs.
