Title: Pi Blog Performance Wall

So I've smashed into my first development wall with Pelican, Lighttpd, and my Raspberry Pi.

I tried to host a photo I took on my phone here on my blog and bam, dead image link.

I spent probably an hour crawling through Lighttpd configs, Pelican configs, and StackOverflow to try and find out why I can't display a simple local picture in a browser. However, when I loaded the same HTML from my local Ubuntu machine, the image showed up!

Damn.

So perhaps my poor little Raspberry Pi is feeling overburdened from trying to be a SFTP file server, a media center, and now a blog host. 

Just damn.
